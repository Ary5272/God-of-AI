# Project Chimera: A Dynamic, Self-Evolving Cognitive Architecture

## 1. Project Objective

Project Chimera is a conceptual framework for a next-generation artificial intelligence. Its goal is to transcend the limitations of current models by integrating advanced causal reasoning, real-time multimodal processing, and a unique self-evolving architecture for unparalleled efficiency and capability. This repository contains the foundational design documents and the skeletal source code for this system.

## 2. Core Architecture: The Modular Cognitive Framework

Chimera is not a monolithic neural network. It is a dynamic, modular framework inspired by the functional specialization of the human brain. It consists of a central reasoning core surrounded by specialized, interconnected modules that can be activated, reconfigured, and even self-generated as needed.

### A. The Causal Reasoning Core (CRC)
The heart of Chimera. The CRC acts as the system's "consciousness," handling high-level reasoning and strategic planning. It now features a **Capability-Based Routing** system. Instead of hard-coded logic, the CRC queries its connected modules to discover which one is best suited for a given task based on the keywords and capabilities they report.

### B. Specialized Cognitive Modules (SCMs)
These are expert "sub-brains" that plug into the CRC. Each SCM now reports a list of its core capabilities (e.g., `'code_analysis'`, `'data_ingestion'`, `'simulation'`) to the CRC. Key modules include:
- **Sensory Fusion Engine (SFE):** Processes and integrates vast, real-time data streams.
- **Abstract Symbology Module (ASM):** The master of logic, mathematics, and computer code.
- **Predictive Simulation Engine (PSE):** Creates high-fidelity "what-if" scenarios.
- **Creative Synthesis Module (CSM):** Generates novel ideas, artistic concepts, and scientific hypotheses.

### C. The Metacognitive Layer
The "overseer" layer that monitors the performance of the entire Chimera system. It analyzes the CRC's routing decisions and the SCMs' performance to identify bottlenecks and opportunities for optimization, including the creation of new SCMs.

## 4. How to Run

1.  Ensure you have the required (conceptual) dependencies.
2.  Run the main entry point:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

***

### `main.py`

Copy the code below for the `main.py` file.

```python
# main.py
# The primary entry point for initializing and interacting with the Project Chimera AI.

from src.chimera_core import Chimera

def run_demonstration():
    """
    Initializes the Chimera system and runs a series of demonstration tasks
    to showcase its new capability-based routing.
    """
    # Initialize the Chimera AI system
    chimera_ai = Chimera()

    # --- Task Demonstration ---
    
    # Task 1: The CRC will identify the 'code' and 'analysis' keywords
    # and route this to the ASM based on its reported capabilities.
    chimera_ai.task("Analyze this Python code snippet for vulnerabilities and suggest optimizations.")
    
    # Task 2: The CRC will identify 'satellite' and 'data' and route
    # this to the SFE.
    chimera_ai.task("Process real-time satellite imagery and weather data to find correlations.")

    # Task 3: The CRC will find the 'simulation' capability in the PSE.
    chimera_ai.task("Run a market forecast simulation based on new trade policies.")

    # Task 4: The CRC will find the 'creative' capability in the CSM.
    chimera_ai.task("Generate three novel concepts for a story about AI.")

    # Task 5: A complex task the CRC will realize requires multiple modules.
    chimera_ai.task("Analyze this scientific paper, run a simulation of its findings, and generate a creative visualization of the results.")
