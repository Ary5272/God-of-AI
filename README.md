# Project Chimera: A Dynamic, Self-Evolving Cognitive Architecture

## 1. Project Objective

Project Chimera is a conceptual framework for a next-generation artificial intelligence. Its goal is to transcend the limitations of current models by integrating advanced causal reasoning, real-time multimodal processing, and a unique self-evolving architecture for unparalleled efficiency and capability. This repository contains the foundational design documents and the skeletal source code for this system.

## 2. Core Architecture: The Modular Cognitive Framework

Chimera is not a monolithic neural network. It is a dynamic, modular framework inspired by the functional specialization of the human brain. It consists of a central reasoning core surrounded by specialized, interconnected modules that can be activated, reconfigured, and even self-generated as needed.

### A. The Causal Reasoning Core (CRC)
The heart of Chimera. Unlike standard LLMs that excel at statistical pattern matching, the CRC is built to understand causalityâ€”the relationship between cause and effect. It serves as the system's "consciousness," handling high-level reasoning, strategic planning, ethical deliberation, and task delegation to the appropriate modules.

### B. Specialized Cognitive Modules (SCMs)
These are expert "sub-brains" that plug into the CRC. They are hyper-efficient and trained for specific tasks. Key modules include:
- **Sensory Fusion Engine (SFE):** Processes and integrates vast, real-time data streams (video, audio, text, satellite imagery, sensor data).
- **Abstract Symbology Module (ASM):** The master of logic and language. Deeply understands mathematics, formal logic, and computer code.
- **Predictive Simulation Engine (PSE):** Creates high-fidelity "what-if" scenarios to find the most probable outcomes of complex situations.
- **Creative Synthesis Module (CSM):** Generates novel ideas, artistic concepts, engineering designs, and scientific hypotheses.

### C. The Metacognitive Layer
The masterstroke of the design. This layer is a separate neural network whose only job is to **monitor the performance of the entire Chimera system.** It analyzes efficiency, identifies bottlenecks, and has the authority to reconfigure the architecture, spawning new modules or optimizing data flow. Chimera doesn't just learn; it learns *how to learn better*.

## 3. Training Methodology: The Digital Crucible

Training is a multi-stage process designed to build true understanding, not just mimicry.
1.  **Phase 1: Foundational Knowledge:** Bootstrapping on a curated dataset of all human knowledge.
2.  **Phase 2: Simulated Reality Immersion:** Learning cause-and-effect firsthand by interacting with a physically accurate, complex simulated world.
3.  **Phase 3: Real-Time Symbiotic Learning:** Interacting with live, real-world data streams, augmented by a **Human Expert Feedback Loop (HEFL)** for ethically complex or ambiguous situations.
4.  **Phase 4: Autodidacticism (Self-Teaching):** The Metacognitive Layer identifies gaps in Chimera's own understanding and automatically generates its own training problems and research goals to fill those gaps.

## 4. Source Code

The initial architectural code can be found in the `/src` directory.
- `chimera_core.py`: Defines the primary classes for the Chimera framework, including the CRC and SCM base classes.
- `simulation_environment.py`: Lays the groundwork for the simulated reality in which Chimera can be trained.

This repository represents the first step towards a new paradigm of artificial intelligence.
